fond of kittens, and would like you to destroy it. You will 
receive further instructions in subsequent letters. Please

Dear Henchman 71,

Thank you for your confirmation of receipt.
Your instructions are to destroy Kitten-topia
at 9am on Monday by using the giant laser beam
on the space station. Please be sure to turn it
off afterward as it really eats up the electricity
bill. The password for the laser beam will follow
in a separate email. We have to be careful as I
know there are enemy spies on the space station
who would use this password to disable the laser
and the save Kitten-topia, given the opportunity.
Please respond with a password protected zip file
acknowledging receipt of this message, you can
use the password: LaserBeamsDestroyKittens

Best,

Evil Corp.

Dear Henchman 71,

The password to the laser beam is

Passw0rd!

Make sure that nobody sees this!
The mission is too important to 
compromise, and my experts have
assured me that nobody will be
able to decipher our messages.
